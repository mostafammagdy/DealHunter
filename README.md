# Final Project for EECS4413

This jar was built for deployment to an AWS Elastic Beanstalk instance.
An running instance can be accessed at http://dealhunter-env.eba-htprj3h6.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/   
It should run 24/7 without requiring the student to restart the AWS academy session

It can also be run by running this jar with the command,then navigating to http://localhost:5000/ on a browser with JavaScript enabled.

    java -jar [thisjar] 


The testcases are directed towards the AWS instance and were written to be ran line-by-line on Windows CMD.
